Subject: PM / hibernate: update the resume offset on SNAPSHOT_SET_SWAP_AREA

The SNAPSHOT_SET_SWAP_AREA is supposed to be used to set the hibernation
offset on a running kernel to enable hibernating to a swap file.
However, it doesn't actually update the swsusp_resume_block variable. As
a result, the hibernation fails at the last step (after all the data is
written out) in the validation of the swap signature in
mark_swapfiles().

Before this patch, the command line processing was the only place where
swsusp_resume_block was set.
